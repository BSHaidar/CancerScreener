# 1. **Business** **Understanding**

## 1a) **Problem Definition**
The  dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images. The collection images represent all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id column within the HAM10000_metadatafile.

Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, with theannual cost of care exceeding $8 billion. With early detection, the 5 year survival rate of the most deadly form, melanoma, can be up to 99%; however, delayed diagnosis causes the survival rate to dramatically decrease to 23%.
