## 1a) **Problem Definition**

Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, with an annual cost of care exceeding $8 billion. With early detection, the 5 year survival rate of the most deadly form, melanoma, can be up to 99%; however, delayed diagnosis causes the survival rate to plummet to 23%.

The  dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images. These collection of images represent almost 95% of diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions seen in clinical settings: 
- Actinic Keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec)
- Basal Cell Carcinoma (bcc)
- Benign Keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl)
- Dermatofibroma (df)
- Melanoma (mel)
- Melanocytic Nevi (nv)
- Vascular Lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id column within the HAM10000_metadatafile.
